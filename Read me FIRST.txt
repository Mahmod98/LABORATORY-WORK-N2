Note 1: You need to install the node-modules on your computer becuae I was not able to upload it with the project file, becuae its
a large file to upload on github even I tried to zip it but it did not work. Also, you will find the node-modules file in github but it does
not contain all files. 

Note 2: You have to install the "uuid" by writeing in the terminal (npm instal uuid).

Note 3: To run the project write in the browser: localhost:3000.
